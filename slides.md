- Nowadays, the world runs on software
 
Stats from Worldmetrics, Shocking Project Failure Statistics: Majority of IT Projects at Risk, July 23, 2024.
75% of business and IT executives anticipate their software projects will fail. The failure rate of IT projects is 43%.
Two-thirds of software projects fail due to cost overruns or delays

- If you want to impact the world, you will want to be as productive as possible

* 6 Globally Distributed Teams
* Some Poorly Performing
* Goal to Improve Delivery Velocity
 
::: notes
engaged 6 teams to interview a subset of people from each team
80 hours of work for the 6 teams
 
* Assumptions:
  * Poor Test Coverage?
  * Technical Debt?

1. Initial thoughts on lack of velocity
:::

# Discovery of Root Causes {data-background-image="images/space_discovery.png"}

### Inefficient Processes and Bottlenecks?

### Technical Debt and Complex Codebases?

### Team Skill Gaps and Collaboration Issues?

* Interviewed 6 Teams
* Used a sampling of people
* About 6 hours per team in just interviews
* Uncovered many more issues

::: notes
Out of over 30 teams
Using our own internal knowledge as a guide

Legacy workflows, unclear requirements, and manual interventions in CI/CD pipelines can slow down development. Removing these inefficiencies and adopting modern tools or automation requires significant effort.

Accumulated technical debt and overly complex or outdated codebases make it harder for teams to deliver quickly. Refactoring or optimizing this code demands time and resources, which slows down immediate velocity improvements.

Teams may lack the necessary skills or training to adopt new tools, frameworks, or methodologies. Poor communication and misalignment between development, QA, and operations can further hamper speed.

But there were some teams with strong practices

:::

# Where to start? {.r-fit-text data-background-image="images/space_building.png"}

- Rely on surveys, not interviews
- Aggregate results at the team level
- Identify areas of synergy

::: notes
- Interviews are time-consuming and biased:
  - not everybody was invited
  - not everybody who was invited spoke their minds
  - a survey would be much better
    - make sure it aggregates results at the team level, not the individual level
:::

# DIY Assessments {data-background-image="images/space_diy.png"}

- Identify your best SDLC practices
- Order them according to priority
- Develop questions with only 3 options (for ease of scoring)
- Have everyone take the survey
- Identify your internal domains of expertise and leverage them
- Repeat every 6 months and monitor progress
